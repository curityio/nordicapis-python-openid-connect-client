# OAuth/OpenID Connect Workshop
This is a OpenID Connect example, used as an assigment in the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect workshop given by Curity AB.

## Dependencies

**python 2.x** (tested with python 2.7.10)

**OpenSSL 1.0** to be able to do modern TLS versions. Python together with 0.9.x has a bug that makes it impossible to select protocol in the handshake, so it cannot connect to servers that have disabled SSLv2.

Python dependencies can be installed by using PIP: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Assignment
There is some blank spaces in the code, which you're supposed to fill in. 

### client.py
1. Fill in the missing data for the token request
    When done, you should be able to get a token from the server

2. Fill in the data for the refresh request
    When done, you should be able to refresh the access token

3. Fill in the data for the revoke request
    When done, you should be able to revoke the access token

### app.py
4. Add the token to the api request
    You should now be able to request data from 

5. Add openid to the requested scopes, in configuration.
    You should get an id_token from the token response

6. Validate the id_token
    Use the validator to validate the id_token


## Running the app

```bash
$ python app.py
```

Flask will start a web server listening on all interfaces. The webserver will by default use HTTPS with a selfsigned certificate for localhost.
Browse to https://localhost:5443 to see the app.

## settings.json
Settings.json is used as a configuration file for the example app. Change the values to match your system.

Name            | Type    | Mandatory | Default  | Description
----------------| ------- | :-------: | -------- | :---------------
`redirect_uri`  | string  |    ✓      |          | The redirect uri to use, must be registered for the client at the OpenID Connect server.
`client_id`     | string  |    ✓      |          | The id for the client. Used to authenticate the client against the authorization server endpoint.
`client_secret` | string  |    ✓      |          | The shared secret to use for authentication against the token endpoint.
`discovery_url` | URL     |    ✓      |          | The URL where the metadata of the sever can be found. Should contain information about the endpoints and keys to be used. Configuration from the discovery url will override configuration from settings.json.
`scope`         | string  |           | `openid` | The scopes to ask for.
`jwks_uri`      | URL     | if `discovery_url` is not set and the `openid` scope is requested          |          | The URL that points to the JWK set.
`authorization_endpoint` | URL | if `discovery_url` is not set     |          | The URL to the authorization_endpoint.
`token_endpoint`| URL     |           |          | The URL to the token_endpoint. Mandatory if `discovery_url` is not set.
`issuer`        | string  | if the `openid` scope is requested and `discovery_url` is not set          |          | The ID of the token issuer.
`verify_ssl_server` | boolean |       | `true`   | Set to false to disable certificate checks.
`debug`         | boolean |           | `false`  | If set to true, Flask will be in debug mode and write stacktraces if an error occurs
`port`          | number  |           | `5443`   | The port that the Flask server should listen to
`disable_https` | boolean |           | `false`  | Set to true to run on http
`base_url`      | string  |           |          | base url to be added to internal redirects. Set this to enable the client to be behind a proxy.
